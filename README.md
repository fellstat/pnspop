# pnspop

While numerous methodologies exist to estimate proportions and means from an respondent driven sample (RDS), estimating population size is more challenging. A privatized network sample (PNS) is similar to an RDS, but also collects identifiers for each individual's network connections protecting privacy through the use of a hash function.

This package implements methods for estimating population size in PNS studies.
