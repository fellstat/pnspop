# Descriptives

This table contains descriptive statistics relevant to PNS population size estimates.

1. **Total Contacts**: The count of the total number of people nominated as contacts 
by participants in the study.
2. **Unique Contacts**: The number of unique hashed identifiers among nominated contacts. If this
nearly the same as Total Contacts, then the population size is likely large. If it is small,
then there are a lot of repeated hashed IDs, indicating a smaller population size.
3. **PNS Sample Size**: The number of study participants who provided a hashed identifier for themselves.
4. **Unique Contacts in Sample**: The number of Unique Contacts that appear among the hashed identifiers of
study participants.
5. **Unique Hashed Identifiers in Contacts and Sample**: The number of unique hashed
identifiers that appear either among the contacts or among study participants. This represents
a minimum of the number of unique individuals directly identified by the study and is a hard
lower bound on population size.
