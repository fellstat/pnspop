# Network Size

This variable is the PNS network size variable. The RDS network size variable
typically looks something like:

"How many <people in the population> do you know, who live in <catchment area> and
who you have had contact with in the last two weeks?"

The PNS question adds the restriction that the subject knows their identifing information.
For instance if the phone number is used in the hash, the PNS netowrk size would be:

"Of those how many do you know their phone number?"
