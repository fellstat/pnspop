# Subject Hash

This is the privatized identifier for the subject. Note that this is distinct from the subject ID.

This identifier is is typically constructed by starting with an identifying piece of
information that is known by other members of the population, such as name or phone number.
That value is then fed though a hasher to privatize it. See application documentation
for details.
